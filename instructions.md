CHALLENGE:

NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO GRAB THE MONGO URI AND PORT FROM THE TEXT FILE TO MAKE THIS WORK!!!!

1. Clean up the 'workout.js' file by creating a 'controllers' folder, and putting
   and creating a 'workoutController.js' file.  Move all functions to this  new
   file and ensure that it still works.

   The 'controllers' folder needs to be in the 'backend' directory

2. Ensure that you use the appropriate model methods in order to execute each
   function properly.
   
   When creating the function that finds all of the workouts, ensure that they are 
   in descending order (new workouts at the top).

3. Ensure that all functions are able to handle errors involving entering values 
   that don't exist when needing an ID.

4. Test all routes out in Postman and ensure they are working properly

NOTE: KNOW THAT WHEN THERE IS NO ID WHEN RETRIEVING DATA, THERE IS A ROUTE THAT WILL
      FIND ALL OF THE ROUTES
