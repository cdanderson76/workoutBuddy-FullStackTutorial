CHALLENGE:

1. Follow the steps to create a MongoDB database (follow the document in your file
   directory).  Move on to the next step once completed.

   Go into MongoDB and find the connection string

2. Create a folder called 'config' within the 'backend' directory.  Create a
   file inside of the config folder called 'db.js'.  Create a function that will connect to the MongoDB database and export it.  Import it into the 'server.js' 
   file.  You will need to import 'Mongoose' into this file to make everything work.

   Log this connection to the console to see if it connected
