CHALLENGE:

1. Create a folder called 'routes' under the 'backend' directory. Under the 'routes' folder, create a file called 'workout.js'. This is where all of the routes will be stored.

2. Import the Express router and start setting up the routes.

3. Add the middleware to send requests to the server in 'server.js'

4. Test all of the routes in Postman. If all of the endpoints connect, then you're all set to go.
