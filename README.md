CHALLENGE:

1. Create a folder on your desktop called 'mern stack', and open it up in VSCode

2. Create a folder called 'backend', and inside of that folder, create a file
   called 'server.js'

3. Change into the 'backend' folder via command line, and install the 'package.json'
   file.  Install the following files:
   
   -Nodeman(globally)
   -Express
   -Mongoose
   -dotenv

5. Create the Express app and define the 'home' route.  Use '4000' for the port
   number, and store it in an environment variable.

6. Make the proper modifications to the 'package.json' file, and then start the
   server.  You should see what you see in Anki if done correctly.

7. Also, use 'localhost' to pull up the browser.  It should say whatever you used
   in the 'response'.
